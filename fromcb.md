# AP Computer Science A Exam

## Unit 1: Primitive Types
> You’ll learn the fundamentals of Java, a programming language, as well as other foundational concepts for coding.

Topics may include:
- Primitive data types
- Evaluating arithmetic expressions in program code
- Using assignment operators to produce a value
- How variables and operators are sequenced and combined in an expression to create a result

## Unit 2: Using Objects
> You’ll explore reference data as a way to represent real-world objects in a digital world and discover methods to perform more complex operations.

Topics may include:
- Objects and classes as ways to describe instances, attributes, and behaviors
- Creating objects by calling constructors with and without parameters
- Utilizing class libraries, including Integer and Double
- Defining an object’s behavior using methods, including static and Math class
- Calling non-static void methods with and without parameters
- Using String objects and methods
- Using application program interfaces (APIs) and libraries

## Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and if Statements
> You’ll delve into the building blocks of algorithms and focus on using conditional statements to solve problems and control results.

Topics may include:
- Finding Boolean values with expressions involving relational operators
- Using conditional statements to execute different statements based on input values
- Building on conditional statements to create multiple possible outcomes
- Creating the same value using equivalent Boolean expressions
Referencing objects with aliases

## Unit 4: Iteration
> You’ll learn about iteration, another building block of algorithms that are for repetition.

Topics may include:
- Creating a loop to run an expression repeatedly until certain conditions are met
- Standard arithmetic-based and String algorithms
- Representing iterative processes in code using for and while loops
- Nesting loop and iteration statements

## Unit 5: Writing Classes
> You’ll explore how real-world interactions can be expressed digitally by organizing behaviors and attributes into classes, and you’ll examine the legal and ethical implications of computer programming.

Topics may include:
- The makeup of a class, including whether attributes are public or private
- Setting an object’s attributes using constructors
- Using comments to describe the functionality of code
- Defining behaviors of an object using non-void, void, and static methods
- Where variables can be used in program code
- Breaking problems into smaller parts by creating methods to solve individual subproblems
- Intellectual property and ethical concerns in programming

## Unit 6: Array
> You’ll learn techniques and standard algorithms to work with collections of related data, known as data structures.

Topics may include:
- Representing multiple related items as array objects
- Traversing an array by accessing the elements using iteration statements
- Standard algorithms that utilize array traversals to perform functions

## Unit 7: ArrayList
> You’ll delve deeper into data sets, exploring ArrayList objects for larger amounts of data, as well as the privacy concerns related to personal data storage.

Topics may include:
- Representing collections of related object reference data using ArrayList objects
- Traversing an ArrayList by accessing the elements using iteration statements
- Standard algorithms that utilize ArrayList traversals to perform functions
- Searching and sorting using standard algorithms
Ethical issues around data collections

## Unit 8: 2D Array
> Now that you’ve explored 1D arrays, you’ll branch out into 2D arrays and experiment with data sets represented in a table.

Topics may include:
- Representing collections of data as arrays of arrays, or 2D arrays
- Traversing a 2D array by accessing the elements using nested iteration statements

## Unit 9: Inheritance
You’ll learn how to manipulate programming without altering existing code by using subclasses to create a hierarchy.

Topics may include:
- Using common attributes and behaviors to group existing objects into superclasses
- Defining and overriding methods within subclasses and superclasses
- Creating references using inheritance hierarchies
- Associating subclass objects with superclasses to create polymorphism

## Unit 10: Recursion
> You’ll work on solving larger problems by solving smaller, simpler versions of the same problem using recursive methods.

Topics may include:
- Executing recursive methods
- Searching and sorting using binary search and merge sort algorithms
